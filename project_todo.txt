show no of day I am working out.

add text to speech and when it is not mute automatically change exercises and tell the user which exercise they are on and when the time gets over. When it is mute allow user to manually change exercise and play beep sound when time gets over.

add animations(optionals but it will be awesome if I add them).

tell yours different facts when all the exercise gets over.

add more options in setting like :
    - changing background color
    - changing exercise duration
    - text to speech related settings
    - add more exercises
    - etc.

add more buttons on top right :
    - volume of beep (use localStorage)
    - etc.

make it responsive

(optionals)
add stats option in which user can check for how many days they are working out.
